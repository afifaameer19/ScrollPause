# ScrollPause
ScrollPause helps users become aware of their scrolling habits without shaming or force. When a time limit is crossed it gently intervenes with a calm pop-up and a short, non-stimulating game to break the scroll loop. Users then reflect on their tasks and choose whether to continue scrolling or focus,with a short lock creating space for reflection.
