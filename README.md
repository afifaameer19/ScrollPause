# ScrollPause
ScrollPause helps users become aware of their scrolling habits without shaming or force. When a time limit is crossed it gently intervenes with a calm pop-up and a short, non-stimulating game to break the scroll loop. Users then reflect on their tasks and choose whether to continue scrolling or focus,with a short lock creating space for reflection.

Description:

ScrollPause helps users become aware of their scrolling habits without shaming or forcing them to stop.
When a user crosses a set scrolling time limit on Reels or Shorts, the app gently intervenes with a calm pop-up instead of an aggressive block. It first engages the user in a short, non-stimulating activity (two rounds of tic-tac-toe) to break the automatic scrolling loop.
After that, the app asks the user to reflect by entering a couple of tasks they actually want or need to do. The user is given a choice—continue scrolling or continue with their tasks—so they remain in control of their decisions.
If the user chooses to focus on tasks, the scrolling apps are temporarily locked for a short period (10–15 minutes), creating a safe space for self-reflection and productivity

How its different from other Blocking apps:

Most existing solutions either completely block apps or bombard users with strict warnings, which often feels frustrating and causes people to uninstall them. The real problem isn’t lack of discipline—it’s the absence of mindful interruption at the right moment.

Scope and Limitations:

Since pop-up overlays are restricted on YouTube, ScrollPause currently uses system notifications as a substitute for pop-ups to trigger mindful intervention. For demo purposes, the scrolling time limit is set to 10 seconds to quickly showcase the complete flow. The app has been developed and tested using the Android Emulator, with further optimization planned for real devices.

Future Enhancements:

We plan to publish ScrollPause on the Google Play Store and request the necessary permissions to enable full pop-up overlays and deeper system integration. Additional improvements will include configurable time limits, enhanced UI polish, and broader testing on physical devices to ensure a smoother and more reliable user experience.
